This is the first simulation turned vidm file.
Each green triangle represents a live dustmite.
Dustmites move about the world eating dust and expending energy.
Each dust eaten provides the mite with 2 energy.
Each step uses one energy.
When a dustmite runs out of energy it dies.
Dead dustmites are red and don't move.

Note:
The video is running at 30 frames per second, so though it looks like all the dustmites die at the same time, they actually don't.
